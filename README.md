## What is it?
> Dude, how cool it would be to have an app to organize all your songs and edit them in real time?

> Say no more!

**Such song** is a web application letting you organize songs and their lyrics. 
You can:
- group them into playlists, 
- create or join user groups
- collaborate on lyrics *in real time(!)*
- hopefully do something more with the app

Ant he best of all, everything is free and open source!

Technically, the app is basing on a NodeJS server using Express, Mongoose and Angular Material in the front end part.
## Quickstart guide
You can start using this app by following a few simple steps:

1. Install and setup required dependencies ([NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/))
2. Make sure the MongoDB deamon is up and running
3. Clone this repository into a directory of your choice and *cd* into that directory. Alternatively you can download the packaged source code and unzip it on your local file system
4. Let npm handle other dependencies by running *npm install*
5. Configure *such-song* in the *config.js* file. See config.js.example 
6. Start the app by executing *npm start*
7. Enjoy!
